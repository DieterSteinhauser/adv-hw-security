GSCLib v1.0 - Nov 19th, 2002

	- Added place holders for Adder, 1/2 Adders and tri-state buffers
	(symbol, verilog, symbolPT, and schematics with pins only).
	- Added new corners to characterization (5364 spectre simulations !)
		- fast/nom/slow @ 2.7V, 27 degC & 125 degC
		- fast/nom/slow @ 3.0V, 27 degC & 125 degC
		- fast/nom/slow @ 3.3V, 27 degC & 125 degC
	- Fixed problem with missing test info in .lib and .tlf for scan
	devices.
	- Fixed some label issues.
	- Abstracts now have inherited connections info attached to
	  terminal. No labels, so not directly visible unless you
	  query properties of the pin.

	== In order to support via stacking and assymetric vias during
	   DEF In, we recommend that you use gpdk_MIET_2.0.1 or
	   later.

GSCLib v0.9 - Oct 5th, 2002

	- SDFFSRX1 (Scan DFF) is now in !
	- Area is now include in TLF/LIB files
	- 6 corners have been used for timing
	  info ! (this means we ran 1788 spectre
	  simulations)
			fast/nom/slow @ 3.3 V, 27 degC
			fast/nom/slow @ 3.0 V, 27 degC

GSCLib v0.8 - Setp 27th, 2002

	- DFF, DFFSR schematic/layout and timing info
	has been completed.

GSCLib v0.7 - Sept 14th, 2002

	- Continuing clean-up/optimization of layouts.
	- TLF has been generated with 4.3 format, to enable
		using with Ambit.

GSCLib v0.6 - Aug 30th, 2002

	- Items are being populated...

GSCLib v0.5 - Aug 24th, 2002

	- A lot of the cells now have abstracts (in dfII)!
	- A lot of the cells have timing info (nominal)!
	- A lot of the cells have verilog/vhdl models !
	- A LEF file (tech & macro) is available...

GSCLib v0.4 - Aug 17th, 2002

	- A lot more layouts are done.
	- CHANGE: the "PWR" pin is now "POWR"
	- All completed schematics now also have a verilog
		representation (look at verilog/GSCLib.v)
	- All completed schematics now also have a VHDL
		representation (look at verilog/GSCLib.vhd)
	- A first cut .lib file is available for the
		completed schematics, for the nominal conditions
		(ie 3V, 27deg, process NN corner).
		NOTE: This has been generated from the schematics,
		and therefore does not include the layout parasitics.
	- A first cut .tlf file is available for the
		completed schematics, for the nominal conditions
		(ie 3V, 27deg, process NN corner).
		NOTE: This has been generated from the schematics,
		and therefore does not include the layout parasitics.

GSCLib v0.3 - Aug 9th, 2002

	- Major changes for nearly all schematics. The base transistor sizes
	have been changed, as well as several schematics have been significantly
	modified as a result of the design review activity.
	- A few layouts are starting to appear...
