The GSCLib_3.0 is a standard cell library that at one time was publicly
available and supported by Cadence Design Systems.  Support for the library
ceased around 2004.  The library is a 180nm technology node that can be used
to perform gate-level synthesis, DFT insertion, layout synthesis, 
and simulations.  

At UConn, the library is available for academic purposes only and is
available in the directory:
/apps/ecs-apps/software/synopsys/GSCLib_3.0
on any machine that has access to the ECS fileserver.  This directory
has several sub-directories that can be used for synthesis or
verification purposes.  A summary of the contents of each sub-directory
is listed below.

The Synopsys database files have been modified to include test functionality
to the SDFFSRX1 cell and have been characterized with new timing delays.
